README - Details content on assignment submission: Lab 3
Makefile - Compiles FileReverse.c & contains commands: clean, check, submit
	 - Assigns FileReverse.c, README. and Makefile as files to submit
FileReverse.c - Produces an identical output as FileReverse.java, but uses
		C programming language
	      - Majority of code is provided by FileIO.c example found in
	      	lab3 instructions (by Prof. Patrick Tantalo)
	      - stringReverse() method was written by me, with some
	        assistance from Thuan during Monday's 3-5pm lab session
